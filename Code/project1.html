        <section> <h3>Home Automation and Monitoring System</h3>
                  <p>I create a  monitoring system using Node-RED and the MQTT protocol.<br>
                  I use a Raspberry Pi as the central server (MQTT broker), where sensors <br>
                  like LDR or a temperature sensor (DHT11) send their data. With Node-RED, <br>
                  I build a visual interface to see this data in real-time and control actions,<br>
                   like turning on or off a light  or opening a door using servo motor.<br>
                  It works like a conversation: sensors "talk" (publish data),the Raspberry Pi<br>
                   "listens" (MQTT broker), and I, through the interface, decide what to do.</p> </section>

        <h3>Environmental Monitoring  Dashboard</h3>
        <p>This project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico with connected sensors <br>
          (DHT11, LDR, and water sensor) to measure environmental parameters:<br>
           temperature, humidity, light intensity, and water presence. Data is<br>
            continuously collected and stored in a CSV file for analysis. A Python-based<br>
             dashboard, built with Tkinter, visualizes these measurements through multiple<br>
              pages for efficient monitoring. The dashboard includes a home page <br>
              introducing the system, a display page with options for viewing <br>
              individual graphs for each sensor, a combined graph showing all parameters together,<br>
               and a table view for raw data. Additionally, a support page is provided for user <br>
               feedback, and a manual page guides users through the application and so much more.<br>
